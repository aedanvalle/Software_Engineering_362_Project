# Software_Engineering_362_Project
OpenWeather software for MacOS

1) Download project, unzip and place on desktop.  

2) Go into folder, now right click all executables and let them run once (Open them when asked).  
    This is how MacOS allows all to run when invoked at their respective times.  
    
3) The main program that manages the other 2 is "362_project", so right click and open it first
    now that all other executables have been given permission to execute.
    
4) Enter in the city and it'll return the current weather for the entered city.  

5) After retriving the single day forecast or 5 day, please exit the program and start it up 
    again to enter another city.  It needs to be fixed to handle more iterations within the same 
    program.  It's a work in progress and might be fixed sometime in the future.
    
NOTE: please see the picture of the resulting output to display what the result is supposed to look like.
